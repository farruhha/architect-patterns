Implementation Guideline

1.  To implement the simple interface to complex subsystem. Subsystems get more complex as they grow

2. They are also used when there are lots of dependencies between the client and concrete implementation
of abstraction

3. We want to layer the subsystem. Use the facade to define entry point to each subsystem level.
